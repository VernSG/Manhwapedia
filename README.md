There is no doubt that most of our childhood was spent watching anime, we have seen and experienced it all. AnimePedia is a thanks-giving repository for the Anime Community ( for all the Otakus out there :) ) where literally anyone can contribute their favourite characters or browse them! A simple application for weebs, made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Website: [ManhwaPedia](https://manhwapedia.site)

Note: <i>This repository is created with the sole intent of guiding beginners to their initial Open Source contributions.</i>
